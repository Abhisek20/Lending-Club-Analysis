# LendingClub
This is an EDA for the lending to the customers based on the different parameters of a customers.



When the company receives a loan application,
the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s
pro􀁿le. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan
results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default,
then approving the loan may lead to a 􀁿nancial loss for the company
The data given below contains the information about past loan applicants and
whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a
person is likely to default.
